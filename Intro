<h1>Does Physics Preclude Free Will?</h1>
<p>Some physicists claim that the notion of free will is incompatible with modern theories of physics, in particular Relativity Theory. 
Furthermore, since the experimental evidence for relativity is so strong, we must abandon the free will as a naive view of the world which 
the advance of physics has shown to be simply untenable.</p>
<p>I aim to demonstrate that such ideas are based on a combination of faulty understanding of relativity theory and muddled philosophy. The 
physicists who promote these ideas do not do so in peer-reviewed scientific publications, as the subject matter lies outside their field of 
expertise. Nor in journals dedicated to philosophy, where they would more properly belong. Rather, they are generally to be found in 
scientific journalism or books of popular science, where outlandish claims can be made without too much scrutiny.</p>
